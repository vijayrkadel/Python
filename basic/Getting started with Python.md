# Getting started with Python

- Created by: Guido van Rossum
- Create date: 20 FEB 1991
- Created from: c and ABC language
	  
### Python is:

1. Procedure oriented (Scriptig (perl and shell scripting)
2. Object oriented ( c++ )

### Python Features
1. simple and easy to learn 
2. freeware and open source ( run java programme on python: jpyhon) 
3. high-level programming 
4. Platform independent ( write once and run anywhere: mac/ windows /Linux) 
5. Portability ( same as above )
6. Dynamically typed 
7. Python is 
	- Object-oriented
	- Procedure-oriented (write a function and call typical times )( without having class and object we can write code ( procedure oriented come in Java in 1.8b called as lambda ) )

8/ Interpreted : 
   Run a code : Java : we need to complie code so java is cales as compiled language  
   				Python:  we don't need to compile while running code so Python is an Interpreted language (default compiler can run compile code by default )

9/ Extensible: native support is there.
	-we can use java code or c code or c++ code in python, no need to change any code. 

10/ Embedded 
	-we can use python programme in any other language so we can say its Embedded.

11/ Extensive Library
	-import modules 
  
### Limitations:
1. performancce is less because of interpreted programming languages
2. not used for mobile applicaion
