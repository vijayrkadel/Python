# Getting started with Python

- Created by: Guido van Rossum
- Create date: 20 FEB 1991
- Created from: c and ABC language
	  
### Python is:

1. Procedure oriented (Scriptig (perl and shell scripting)
2. Object oriented ( c++ )

### Python Features
1. simple and easy to learn 
2. freeware and open source ( run java programme on python: jpyhon) 
3. high-level programming 
4. Platform independent ( write once and run anywhere: mac/ windows /Linux) 
5. Portability ( same as above )
6. Dynamically typed 
7. Python is 
	- Object-oriented
	- Procedure-oriented (write a function and call typical times )( without having class and object we can write code ( procedure oriented come in Java in 1.8b called as lambda ) )

8. Interpreted : 
   - Java : we need to complie code so java is called as compiled language  
   - Python:  we don't need to compile while running code so Python is an Interpreted language (default compiler can run compile code by default )

9. Extensible: native support is there.
	-we can use java code or c code or c++ code in python, no need to change any code. 

10. Embedded 
	-we can use python programme in any other language so we can say its Embedded.

11. Extensive Library
	-import modules 
  
### Limitations:
1. performancce is less because of interpreted programming languages
2. not used for mobile applicaion 

# Favours of python:

1. cpython: work with c application 
2. jpyton: Java application
3. Iron-python: .net framework 
4. pypy: python for speed ( internally python virtual machine uses JIT compiler(just in time compiler ) )
5. Ruby python: worked with ruby python
6. Anaconda python:  for big data 
7/stackless python: python for concurrency
